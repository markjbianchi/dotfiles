# Mark Bianchi Dot Files

This is my attempt at organizing and managing my dotfiles. Heavily leveraged
from others on github. I have used some of the methods from [Jake Zimmerman][jez_dot],
who advocates the use of the [rcm] package. There is also some excellent resources
online at <https://dotfiles.github.io>.

I am mostly running on Mac OS X, sometimes linux and cygwin. On OS X, I am using
Homebrew + iTerm2 most of the time. I also have been integrating most of Jake's
[vim-as-ide][ide] for vim configuration.
